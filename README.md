An R2 Bucket, and a Worker that serves files from it:

```typescript
import * as Cloudflare from "alchemy/Cloudflare";
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
import * as HttpServerResponse from "effect/http/HttpServerResponse";

export const Uploads = Cloudflare.R2.Bucket("Uploads");

export default Cloudflare.Worker(
  "Api",
  { main: import.meta.url },
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const bucket = yield* Cloudflare.R2.ReadWriteBucket(Uploads);

    return {
      fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
        const obj = yield* bucket.get("hello.txt");
        return obj
          ? HttpServerResponse.text(yield* obj.text())
          : HttpServerResponse.text("Not found", { status: 404 });
      }),
    };
  }).pipe(Effect.provide(Cloudflare.R2.ReadWriteBucketBinding)),
);
```

One `ReadWriteBucket(Uploads)` call adds the Worker binding at deploy time and hands back a typed client at runtime.

---

- **One program, one language.** Resources, Lambdas/Workers, IAM, and SDKs live in the same Effect program — no YAML, no second runtime.
- **Bindings, not glue code.** `AWS.S3.GetObject(bucket)` wires the IAM policy, env var, and a typed SDK call in a single line.
- **Errors in the type system.** Every cloud API failure is a tagged Effect error you handle — or don't — on purpose.
- **Many clouds, one model.** AWS, Cloudflare, GCP, Fly, Hetzner, Kubernetes, Railway, Neon, PlanetScale, Stripe, and more.
- **Same code, every stage.** Local dev, `plan` / `deploy`, smoke tests, and CI all share one mental model.

```sh
pnpm add alchemy@latest effect @effect/platform-bun @effect/platform-node
```

## GitHub Action

Use the root action to deploy `prod` from `main`, deploy PR previews as
`staging-{number}`, and destroy PR previews when the PR closes:

```yaml
- uses: alchemy-run/alchemy@main
  env:
    CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID: ${{ vars.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID }}
    CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

The workflow must install the `alchemy` CLI before this action runs.

## Bootstrap with an AI coding agent

Paste this into Claude Code, Cursor, or any agent that can fetch a URL:

```
You are an Alchemy expert. Read https://alchemy.run/llms.txt to load the
full documentation index, then act as my pair on this project.

Goal: help me set up, build, test, and deploy a cloud application with
`alchemy` (Infrastructure-as-Effects, powered by Effect).

Follow the patterns from the docs and the /examples folder. Stay idiomatic
to Effect: use Layers for wiring, return Effects from lifecycle code, and
keep infra and runtime in the same program. Ask before introducing new
dependencies or breaking conventions.
```
