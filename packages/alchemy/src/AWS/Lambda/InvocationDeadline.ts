/**
 * Flush telemetry for an invocation that is still running `margin` before
 * Lambda's hard timeout — without touching the handler.
 *
 * A Lambda that hits its timeout is killed mid-flight: the telemetry
 * exporter's buffer and the still-open root span die with it — precisely
 * the invocation you most want a trace for. The deadline is known up front
 * (`context.getRemainingTimeInMillis()`), and a sandbox only ever handles
 * one invocation at a time, so a pre-deadline timer is race-free. It parks
 * for `remaining - margin` and, if the handler is still running by then:
 *
 * 1. ends the current span (the `http.server` root span on the HTTP path)
 *    with {@link InvocationTimeoutError} and marks it
 *    {@link TIMEOUT_IMMINENT_ATTRIBUTE};
 * 2. logs a warning through the invocation's logger, so the log record
 *    carries the trace id;
 * 3. drains every exporter through the OTLP {@link Flusher}.
 *
 * The handler is never interrupted and the invocation's outcome is never
 * changed. If Lambda kills the invocation, the trace already exists. The
 * root span is exported exactly once: if the handler finishes inside the
 * margin, its response goes out as normal but the span keeps the
 * timeout-imminent status — it did nearly time out. Spans still open at the
 * flush (other than the root) are not exported; anything already ended,
 * and every log record, is.
 *
 * The margin comes from `ALCHEMY_LAMBDA_TIMEOUT_MARGIN_MS`
 * ({@link FunctionCommonProps.timeoutMargin} on the deploy side; default
 * {@link DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MARGIN_MS}); `0` disables it. Without a
 * `HandlerContext` (unit tests, non-Lambda hosts) the effect runs
 * unguarded.
 *
 * Guards nest: an inner guard (the HTTP listener's, placed inside the
 * `http.server` span so the flush can end it) takes the deadline over from
 * the outer one (the dispatcher's), so the flush runs once, from the
 * innermost guard, closest to the work.
