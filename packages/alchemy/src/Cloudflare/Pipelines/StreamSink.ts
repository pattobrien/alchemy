/**
 * Binding service that exposes a Pipelines {@link Stream} as an Effect
 * `Sink`: run a `Stream` of records into it and every element is
 * ingested. Also exported as `Cloudflare.Basin.StreamSink`.
 *
 * Records are typed, validated and encoded by the stream's Effect Schema
 * (plain JSON objects when it has none). Each upstream chunk is packed
 * greedily into requests of at most 5 MB, preserving order.
 *
 * Provide `StreamSinkBinding` (native Worker binding), `StreamSinkHttp`
 * (scoped `Pipelines Send` token) or `StreamSinkLocal` (current
 * credentials, for Actions) — each is the sink layered over the matching
 * `WriteStream` implementation.
 * ### Draining a Stream into a Pipelines Stream
 * **Example:** Run an Effect Stream into a Pipelines stream
 * ```typescript
 * export default Cloudflare.Worker(
 *   "Api",
 *   { main: import.meta.url },
 *   Effect.gen(function* () {
 *     const sink = yield* Cloudflare.Basin.StreamSink(PageViews);
 *     return {
 *       fetch: Effect.gen(function* () {
 *         yield* EffectStream.fromIterable(views).pipe(EffectStream.run(sink));
 *         return HttpServerResponse.empty({ status: 202 });
 *       }),
 *     };
 *   }).pipe(Effect.provide(Cloudflare.Basin.StreamSinkBinding)),
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * **Example:** Controlling request size
 * ```typescript
 * // at most 500 records per send
 * yield* events.pipe(EffectStream.rechunk(500), EffectStream.run(sink));
 * ```
