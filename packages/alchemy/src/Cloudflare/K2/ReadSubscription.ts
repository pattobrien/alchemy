/**
 * Binding service that turns a K2 {@link Subscription} into a pull client:
 * lease a batch of records, then acknowledge it (advance the subscription),
 * nack it (redeliver), or extend its five-minute lease.
 *
 * The native `k2` Worker binding can only produce, so this service ships
 * HTTP implementations only: {@link ReadSubscriptionHttp} (scoped
 * `K2 Consume` token) and {@link ReadSubscriptionLocal} (current
 * credentials). For a long-running consumer loop, see
 * `consumeStreamRecords`.
 * ### Pulling Records
 * **Example:** Lease, process, and acknowledge a batch
 * ```typescript
 * const inbox = yield* Cloudflare.K2.ReadSubscription(Analytics);
 *
 * const batch = yield* inbox.consume({ workerId: "worker-1", maxRecords: 100 });
 * if (Option.isSome(batch)) {
 *   yield* Effect.forEach(batch.value.records, (record) =>
 *     Effect.log(new TextDecoder().decode(record.content)),
 *   );
 *   yield* inbox.ack(batch.value);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Redelivery
 * **Example:** Release a batch for redelivery
 * ```typescript
 * yield* process(batch.records).pipe(
 *   Effect.andThen(inbox.ack(batch)),
 *   Effect.catch(() => inbox.nack(batch)),
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * @binding
 * @product K2
 * @category Storage & Databases
