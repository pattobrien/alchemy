 * Entry point of the one-shot Vite *build* child spawned by
 * `runViteBuildChild` (`ViteChild.ts`), with the project root as its
 * working directory. Running the build out of process is the isolation
 * boundary: vite resolves a relative root against live `process.cwd()`,
 * plugins read cwd freely, and the build's own spawns (via cross-spawn)
 * `process.chdir` the hosting process transiently — none of which is safe
 * inside the concurrent engine/test process.
 *
 * Protocol: V8-serialized {@link ViteBuildChildConfig} on stdin; the child
 * writes the V8-serialized {@link ViteBuildChildResult} to
 * `config.outputPath` and exits 0. Build logs stream over stdout/stderr;
 * a failed build exits non-zero with the error on stderr.
