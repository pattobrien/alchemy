/**
 * Node.js 24 Fetch function, with native and Effect entrypoints.
 *
 * Functions have public URLs. The `functions:invoke` credential scope does not
 * establish a private invocation policy. Authenticate requests in your handler.
 * Native same-branch database/storage credentials are injected by Neon; a typed
 * read-only binding does not restrict the credentials available to the process.
 * Explicit adoption takes ownership of user-defined environment names: existing
 * keys omitted from `env` and bindings are removed. Values are write-only, so
 * cached digests cannot detect out-of-band value drift.
 *
 * ### Streaming disconnects <!-- api-prose -->
 *
 * Neon’s production host currently does not reliably propagate client disconnects
 * to uncompressed response streams. An abandoned stream can retain its producer
 * and request-scoped resources until it finishes. Prefer finite responses and
 * application-bounded streams; do not rely on disconnect cleanup for long-lived
 * streaming workloads until [the upstream issue](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon-pkgs/issues/636)
 * is resolved. Alchemy propagates abort and body-cancel signals when the host supplies them.
 *
 * ### Native Fetch
 * **Example:** Bundle a native object, bare handler, or Hono application
 * ```typescript
 * const api = yield* Neon.Function("Api", { branch, main: "./src/api.ts" });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Effect Fetch
 * **Example:** Class entrypoint
 * ```typescript
 * export default class Api extends Neon.Function<Api>()(
 *   "Api", { branch, main: import.meta.url },
 *   Effect.succeed({ fetch: Effect.succeed(HttpServerResponse.text("ok")) }),
 * ) {}
 * ```
 *
 * ### Prebuilt Applications
 * **Example:** Deploy Website build output without rebundling
 * ```typescript
 * const site = yield* Neon.Function("Site", { branch, artifact: { directory: "./dist" } });
 * ```
 *
 * @resource
 * @product Function
