/**
 * Per-file registration state.
 *
 * While a test file's module body is evaluating, `describe`/`test`/hook
 * calls register nodes against that file's collector. The runner may call
 * `collect` for many files at once, but collections run one at a time: each
 * waits its turn on a process-wide queue, sets the collector in a plain slot,
 * imports the file and flushes the microtasks it queued, then clears the slot.
 * Attribution therefore never depends on the runtime carrying async context
 * through `import()` (Bun 1.4 does not), including registrations deferred with
 * `queueMicrotask` and module bodies that use top-level `await`.
 *
 * The state lives on `globalThis` so that a duplicated module instance
 * (e.g. two resolutions of the package) still shares one registry.
